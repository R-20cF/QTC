# A Basic Circuit for Implementing a Well-Known Quantum Teleportation Protocol

This circuit is based on a Qiskit tutorial. It contains a few features for verification that are not needed for the teleportation itself. The state to be teleported is qubit 0; the sender ('Alice') has qubit 1 while the receiver ('Bob') has qubit 2.
